# uhc-core-plugin

UHC Core is written by nichxlas98 in Java. This plugin adds the following:
- A FastUHC command that lets makes all tools except Diamond & Gold auto-enchanted. (/fastson, /fastsoff)
- A "Golden Head" custom craft that can be crafted with one Skeleton skull & eight gold.
- A "/startgame" command that spreads out all in-game players & starts shrinking a border.
- A "/endgame" command that teleports all players back to your set spawnpoint & ends the game.
- A "/createborder" command that creates a shrinking border of 2500x2500.
- A "/createspawn" command that creates a server-spawnpoint.
- A "/gotospawn" command that teleports you to your set spawnpoint.

- On a player's death, it sets that player to Spectator Mode & sends a death-message.
- On a player's death, it gives the player's killer a Skeleton Skull that can be used to craft a Golden Head.
- On a player's death, it gives the killer speed 2 & regeneration 3.

- If all players online are dead, it'll broadcast a win event.


This project is still in BETA & will continue recieving updates.
